### List of Governments ###

Because we have so many Governments, and they need to be referenced fairly often in each other files, we have this list so you can double-check if you didn't miss anything while modding the governments.


## Explanation for the "PC" and "NPC" governments ##

City and Temple based governments are not playable in CK2 engine.
Most mods just move everyone over to Castle, but this breaks the game rules in certain ways, mostly having to do with taxes and levies, but it also confuses the AI (that use government type for some decisions) and breaks some triggers here and there.

A Solution was to double the governments in question with a PC and an NPC version, the PC version has ai = no, while the NPC version has an ai = yes on the potential.

The result of this, is if the player is given somehow (inheritance, being granted, etc...) a "npc" government, it switched to the "pc" version automatically, this version is "feudal", it DOES cause the issues mentioned above, but dosn't cause a gameover, and the player is just one of the many characters so probably the issues will be less obvious.

An issue with this though, is that you CAN'T switch government using console commands to one of these, if you use "play" and choose a "NPC" version of government, you will get insta-gameover.
