While trying to figure out how exactly how the council voting works, I managed to use "log" inside the voting conditions to log the scopes and whatever else I needed.

The voting is seemly done in two steps, once to figure out the tooltip of who would be for or against the law. The second step is when the characters actually vote. I didn't found out when the real vote happens, I only found out it takes some time. It would be great if the time for the vote to happen could be modded too.

The scopes seemly are:

ROOT/THIS: always the voter.
FROM: seemly is always whoever called for the vote to be made (isn't necessarily the title owner, could be a councillor for example)
FROMFROM: during the  first step is always the title that has laws being modified. on the second step: if it is a demesne law, it changes to be the ruler. if it is a crown law, it remains being the title.
FROMFROMFROM and onwards: seemly same as FROMFROM, but not 100% sure of this yet.
