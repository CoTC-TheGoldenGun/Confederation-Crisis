# There are several election styles possible
# First choice is if it is direct or indirect
# In direct version, the electors (whoever they are) vote for the ruler they want.
# In the indirect version, they elect the senate, and the senate vote for the ruler in question.
# Our indirect version will be one where only the liege council can vote.
# The direct version can allow vassals and representatives of the population (if appropriate)
# Second choice is who can vote, it could be the population in general, nobility, generals, etc...
# Finally, elections can be proportional, with each voter having one vote, or have that differently on purpose.
