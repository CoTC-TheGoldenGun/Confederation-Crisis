# Sol Route

# This trade route is for exporting sol-made finished goods to the colonies
# It is the oldest trade-route and specialized in helping with the colonization
# Trade goods include construction materials, ships, cultural products, food
# It doesn't increase the income directly of the people downstream, since its
# purpose, is provide infrastructure and basic living conditions.

# It does made Earth fabulously wealthy, being able to sell all that stuff for the outside world.
