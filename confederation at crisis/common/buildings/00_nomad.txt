 # Triggers are in Province scope. The From Scope contains the settlement holder (character)
 # start trigger is in title scope.
 # For nomad capitals, remember than the tech requirement trigger should be applied to the nomad
 # (which means it uses the character's primary tech status, i.e. the nomad capital status
 # for nomads, capital province tech status otherwise). I.e. use the FROM scope for nomad capital buildings.
