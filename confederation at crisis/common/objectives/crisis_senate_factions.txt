#You are wondering what this file is for, isn't you?
#Well, the old factions still work but are clunky, mostly because of features CK2 didn't had back then when they were written.
#Modifying them looks quite ambitious undertaking, so I concluded a better idea is write new factions, and when they become better than old ones, remove them.


# Faction tags need to start with 'faction_'

# Supported types:
# liege_titles, liege_titles_w_claimant, character

# The succession law factions have hard coded elements to ensure that the correct heir is shown in Plot and
# Faction interfaces and that AI faction members vote for laws in accordance with the faction goal.
# The valid tags correspond to the law name: faction_succ_seniority, faction_succ_primogeniture, etc.
# (faction_succ_ultimogeniture is fully supported by the code, but not currently implemented)
