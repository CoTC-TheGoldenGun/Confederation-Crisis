BM_WARLORDS_DESC;The TERRAN CONFEDERATION, once synonymous with the very concept of human civilization, has collapsed underneath the weight of its failures. Terran Authority has all but evaporated and left none but powerful WARLORDS in charge of billions of souls as brother duels brother in mad attempts to restore the peace. \n\nIn the corners of burning cities and piles of wasted lives, some begin to question what lengths should they stoop to stop the chaos. With every million casualty "skirmish", the bar continues to descend.  With most of humanity in the hands of a few what will become of this once proud race? While some use their power to slowly rebuild, there are others who wish to put their mark on humanity forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1234931;When Alejandra joined the Solar Cult against her family's wishes, the furthest thing on her mind was the prospect of ruling her family's Megacorporation, considering she was the youngest of several sisters and had conflicting values.  In the aftermath of the Confederate Civil War she seized control of the Vega Sector and the family corporation to become the only independent power ruled by the Solar Cult. With aggressive Terran Imperials on one side seeking to retake the de-jure Confederate land and end corporate rule, and the Pilgrim state of Tierra Celeste seeking to unite the region on the other, will Alejandra and the Salazar Corporation be able to endure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
