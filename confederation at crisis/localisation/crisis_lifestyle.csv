EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10;You've always had an interest in botany - from the humble flowers of Earth to the most exotic of alien flora, from the oak tree to the [GetRandomPlantName]. You're considering starting a garden, with a focus on exotic alien plants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE10;I couldn't imagine a finer goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE10;Plants aren't for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE11;You've always had an interest in both the natural world and the unnatural one. You find your curiosity constantly piqued. The universe is vast and full of wonders. You want to know more. You NEED to know more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE11;I will dedicate my life to the pursuit of knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE11;There are more important things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE12;Lately, you've been getting into sports [Root.GetAthleticsMotive]. You're considering trying out for the local amateur football team.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

String_to_fully_test_the_abilities_of_your_cybernetics;to fully test the abilities of your cybernetics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE12;Sounds like a great idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE12;Sounds like a waste of time and effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE13;You're fascinated by the wildlife of [homeworld.GetName] - and not in a sense of pure scientific curiosity, but in a far more visceral one. There are giant creatures and ferocious beasts out there to contend with. You yearn for the thrill of the predator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE13;Let the hunt begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE13;Actually, no, it's the curiosity thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE14;Most see falconry as an antiquated pursuit, a favored pastime of ancients long consigned to history. You disagree. You think it's time such noble pursuits were brought back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE14;Fetch me a falcon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE14;On second thought, maybe the past should stay in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE15;You have more unfinished novellas than you do hairs. The size of your documents folder has exceded the orbit of Neptune. Yesterday you got into a heated argument about the Oxford comma. Maybe it's time to come clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE15;I'm a writer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE15;I can quit any time I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE16;The world you see in your mind's eye needs to escape. In your free time, you find yourself sketching, trying to put your vision on paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE16;I'm an artist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE16;I have no real interest in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE17;You find yourself naturally drawn to the martial arts - interested in everything from fistfights to how properly handle a laser pistol. And not just for practical reasons - you enjoy the challenge and the competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE17;All will fall before my blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE17;Perhaps I should consider a less violent hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE18;Travelling through hyperspace is more than enough to realize just how small the human experience really is. The galaxy is vast, and our knowledge small. Who knows what could be lurking out there, beyond the skin of the world we know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE18;I will discover the deep mysteries of the cosmos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE18;No, even the strangest things can be understood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE19;You've been spending an awfully long time in VR lately. The real world is so prosaic, so dull. You much prefer building 23rd century space colonies and gunning down hordes of goblins to doing your actual job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE19;We live in a society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE19;Bottom text.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE210;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] is an avid gardener, who dedicates [From.GetHerHis] free time to maintaining a beautiful garden of exotic alien plants. Just taking a walk through it with [From.GetHerHim] is breathtaking, as [From.GetSheHe] enthusiastically shows off every individual specimen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE210;I think I might take this up myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE210;I'll leave stuff like this to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE211;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] seems to know absolutely everything. [From.GetSheHeCap] spends entire evenings talking about the details of things you didn't even know existed. It always makes for fascinating conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE212;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] is one of the finest athletes you know, even if [From.GetSheHe] doesn't do it professionally. Today, [From.GetSheHe] challenged you to a one-on-one, and of course soundly defeated you, but you had the time of your life doing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE213;Today, your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] took you on a hunting expedition. You'd never thought much of hunting before, but you have to admit, you enjoyed the thrill of matching wits with some of the most formidable creatures in the galaxy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE214;One of your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName]'s eccentricities is [From.GetHerHim] love of falconry. You'd always thought it was a strange and unusual hobby, but today you accompanied [From.GetHerHim] on a hunt, and you have to admit, you're a little jealous of the rapport [From.GetSheHe] seems to have with [From.GetHerHis] avian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE215;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] is an avid writer, with multiple published works. You've always enjoyed reading samples of [From.GetHerHis] works, but you find yourself wishing you could talk to [From.GetHerHim] more about the creative process behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE216;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] is an artist, who spends long hours each day crafting visual splendors in holovision. You spent an hour today just watching [From.GetHerHim] work, fascinated by every detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE217;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] is an avid martial artist, and today [From.GetSheHe] invited you to attend a training session. You lost horribly in the sparring, of course, but you found the entire thing fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE218;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] is, not to put too fine a point on it, weird. [From.GetSheHeCap] calls [From.GetHerselfHimself] a "scientist", but [From.GetSheHe] seems to be spend all [From.GetHerHis] time on things like the Navier-Stokes-Fuchida conjecture and the artificial intelligence problem. You can't help but admit, though, that these unsolved mysteries have a certain appeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE219;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] is a huge fan of VR gaming. Today, [From.GetSheHe] invited you to try out one of the latest releases with [From.GetHerHim], and you have to admit - you had a lot of fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE310;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked you if you could lend [From.GetHerHim] a few seeds to start a garden of [From.GetHerHis] own today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE310;Finally, I'll be able to talk to [From.GetHerHim] about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE311;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked if [From.GetSheHe] could borrow a few files from your personal archive today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE312;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked if [From.GetSheHe] could join you for practice today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE313;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked if [From.GetSheHe] could join you on your next hunting expedition today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE314;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked you for advice on selecting a falcon today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE315;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked you for advice on writing today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE316;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked you for advice on holosculpting today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE317;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked to spar with you today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in your hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE318;Your friend [From.GetCrisisBestName] asked you about your theories on [Root.GetUnsolvableProblem] today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has taken an interest in the deeper mysteries of the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

String_lifestyle_friendship_hunter;You meet [This.GetCrisisBestName] at a conference on the topic of wildlife conservation. You and [This.GetSheHe] swap stories of great hunts gone by and scars earned in the pursuit of the galaxy's most dangerous creatures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_lifestyle_friendship_falconer;It's rare to meet a fellow falconer, so of course when a convention is held in the [Root.Location.GetName] System, you're happy to attend. You spend a pleasant afternoon hunting alongside [This.GetCrisisBestName], who makes for fantastic conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_lifestyle_friendship_poet;You meet [This.GetCrisisBestName] at a writers' workshop, where the two of you are both working on improving your [Root.GetRandomWritingSkill]. You find [This.GetHerHim] surprisingly pleasant company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_lifestyle_friendship_artist;You are attending an exhibition of [This.GetCrisisBestName]'s work when you're shocked to discover the [This.GetManWoman] [This.GetHerselfHimself] is in attendance. You're thrilled to get a chance to speak to [This.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You meet [This.GetCrisisBestName] while watching from the stands - apparently, [This.GetSheHe] made the same mistake. The two of you manage to amuse yourselves by providing commentary on the ongoing match.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_lifestyle_friendship_mystic;The [Root.Location.GetName] System is hosting an "academic symposium", but when you attend, you are disappointed to find that most of the attendees possess small minds and smaller imaginations. You find yourself relaxing at the cafe when you overhear [This.GetCrisisBestName] expounding on the topic of [This.GetUnsolvableProblem]. You're quick to insert yourself into the conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_lifestyle_friendship_gamer;The [Root.Location.GetName] System is hosting a competitive gaming tournament. Unfortunately, it's for a game you don't play, but you still have little better to do with your time than attend. You meet [This.GetCrisisBestName] in one of the side-events, where [This.GetSheHe] impresses you with the extent of [This.GetHerHis] skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE0;This looks like the start of a wonderful friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE0;I don't think we'll be seeing each other again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1010;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a specimen of onideguzu, the Demon Creeping Vine of Hiyokuna Oka. This plantoid species is renowned for its motility and unusual behaviors - it is perhaps one of the most intriguing xenobotanical specimens you could hope to acquire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1110;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a young giant mangrove from Omid III. This tree-like species stands on impressive networks of stilt roots that in the wild can cover an area of over a square kilometer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1210;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a steelwood sapling from Nae Bangladesa II. This tree-like species is named for its bark, the strongest known organic substance in the galaxy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1310;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a colony of Chengu coral. Native to Chengdu Prime, this species of polyps forms exotic and colorful reefs not just in water but also on land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1410;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a specimen of razorgrass. This plantoid species is native to Pu-Erh, and in fact its leaves are responsible for that planet's famous luxury teas. Of course, it's also an extremely dangerous species, with blades sharp enough to sever a human limb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1510;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a Mti wa Nyongo Tree. This species has one of the most fascinating life-cycles in the known worlds - its "seeds" are in fact tiny insectoid creatures, known as metagenic wasps, that seek out the ideal place for its offspring to grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1610;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a clipping of the legendary World Tree of Takagi III! Once thought to be a thick forest of redwood-like dendroids, the World Tree was discovered to be a single clonal organism that covered almost the entirety of Takagi III's sole continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1710;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a specimen of herba da vella from Nueva Galicia. This grass-like species is named for the beautiful colors it can produce through the correct epigentic triggers, creating fields and gardens that resemble vibrant rainbows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE1810;You've found a rare opportunity - the chance to purchase a Touchdown tumbleweed. Unlike Terran tumbleweeds, this plant actually detaches itself from the ground entirely, able to survive on stored water until it finds a place richer in nutrients to sink in its roots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE1010;This will make the perfect addition to my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE1010;I can't afford it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10010;After several weeks of effort, you have successfully managed to set off the correct epigenetic triggers in your herba da vella to grow a solid patch of red grass. Strategically placed, it looks beautiful in your garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE10010;A satisfying job well done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10110;After several weeks of effort, you have successfully managed to set off the correct epigenetic triggers in your herba da vella to grow a solid patch of green grass, which may not sound particularly impressive, but nevertheless makes a fine sight in your garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10210;After several weeks of effort, you have successfully managed to set off the correct epigenetic triggers in your herba da vella to grow a solid patch of blue grass. Strategically placed, it looks beautiful in your garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10310;Without your consistent and diligent care, the solid patch of red grass in your specimen of herba da vella has become so intermixed with other colors that it is no longer visible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE10310;A pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE10310;Well, this is frustrating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLIFESTYLE10310;All that work for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10410;Without your consistent and diligent care, the solid patch of green grass in your specimen of herba da vella has become so intermixed with other colors that it is no longer visible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10510;Without your consistent and diligent care, the solid patch of blue grass in your specimen of herba da vella has become so intermixed with other colors that it is no longer visible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10610;You decided to tend to your onideguzu specimen today. That may have been a mistaken. The plant lashed out at you with its tendrils and knocked you backwards into a glass display case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE10610;Destroy it immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE10610;Keep it anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10710;You've been keeping close tabs on your onideguzu specimen today. It's still alive - in fact, it seems to be in perfect health - but its colors have faded. Once it displayed a kaleidoscope of images on its writhing tendrils. Now they hang limp and are a dull green. Even when it's in bloom, the tendrils stay dimmed. It's almost like it's moping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE10710;What strange behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10810;You went to tend to your onideguzu specimen today, and to your surprise it reacted to you. The moment you began to water it, its tendrils perked up and turned a bright cherry red, the brightest color you've seen from it in quite some time. You're not sure what's happening, but it seems to respond positively to your presence now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE10810;At lest it's well-behaved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE10910;As you were watering your onideguzu specimen today, its tendrils suddenly twisted and turned a bright cherry red, then violet, then gold, writhing like a nest of colorful snakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE10910;It was a beautiful display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE11810;You've spent several weeks now studying the bark of your steelwood tree. It's the strongest known organic substance in the known worlds, stronger even than some materials used in modern combat armor. While you don't think you'll be plating any warships in steelwood timber like a second millennium galleon, there's a lot to be learned about materials science here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE11810;Although the galleon thing would certainly be amusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE11910;Your garden is a corncucopia of the strange and exotic, filled with plantoids and fungoids from across the known worlds. You've recently been making a study of your [examined_plant.GetName] in particular. There's a lot to be learned here about xenobiology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE11910;This may help our colonization efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE12010;It's taken you months, but you've managed to herd a cluster of Chengdu coral polyps in such a way as to create a little decorative sculpture. Soon the polyps will die and it will turn bleach white, but even then, your art will persist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALIFESTYLE12010;Keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLIFESTYLE12010;Sell it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLIFESTYLE20010;Unfortunately for your [dead_plant.GetName], you are in no position to provide the tender care it requires. Without your diligent attention, it has failed to reproduce, withered, and died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

onideguzu_specimen;Onideguzu Specimen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
onideguzu_specimen_desc;The onideguzu is an omnivorous creeping vine-like species native to the planet Hiyokuna Oka. An onideguzu plant consists of a central tuber covered in hair-like fibers, which grow out from the plant to become its roots and creeping vine tendrils, which themselves grow their own layers of fiber. Within the fibers lie a rudimentary nervous system, which enables surprisingly rapid movement. They reproduce by growing dull and colorless flowers, advertising these flowers to pollinating insectoids by the release of pigment in the surrounding vines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
omidi_giant_mangrove_specimen;Omidi Giant Mangrove;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
omidi_giant_mangrove_specimen_desc;Native to Omid III, the giant mangrove is a dendroid species that can grow to immense sizes. It consists of a central trunk that resembles a wooden braid, from which grows an elaborate network of branches supported by adventitious stilt roots that hold the tree above the water level during Omid III's rainy season. A single giant mangrove's root network can cover an entire square kilometer. This one is considerably smaller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steelwood_specimen;Steelwood Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steelwood_specimen_desc;The steelwood is a dendroid species native to the tropics of Nae Bangladesa II. While superficially resembling a Terran tree, they are especially notable for the extreme strength and hardness of their wood, which has evolved to resist Nae Bangladesa II's frequent tropical storms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chengdu_coral_specimen;Chengdu Coral Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chengdu_coral_specimen_desc;An aerobic polyp species native to Chengdu Prime, Chengdu coral resembles Terran corals, but is capable of surviving on land. It naturally forms elaborate and colorful reefs that dominate Chengdu Prime's lowlands. Growing it in higher gravity environments is difficult, but with careful cultivation practices it can grow into elaborate and beautiful patterns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
razorgrass_specimen;Razorgrass Specimen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
razorgrass_specimen_desc;Native to Pu-Erh, razorgrass is a violet grass-like species known for two properties. The first is its role in the production of Pu-Erh tea, which is widely considered some of the finest in the known worlds. The second is the silica phytolith formed on its blades, which is sharp enough to sever a human limb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
metagenic_wasp_specimen;Mti wa Nyongo Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
metagenic_wasp_specimen_desc;Native to Kimbilio II, the mti wa nyongo is a flowering dendroid notorious for its unique life cycle - its "flowers" are in fact eggs that hatch into small, flying insectoids, known as metagenic wasps. The wasps possess a rudimentary intelligence that allows them to seek out ideal growing locations, where they entomb themselves in the soil. The wasp's body forms a natural shell around the tree's seed, protecting it from the elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
world_tree_specimen;World Tree Clipping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
world_tree_specimen_desc;The World Tree of Takagi III is sometimes mistaken for an immense forest of redwood-like dendroids, but it is in fact a single clonal organism that covers almost the entirety of the planet's sole continent, held off only by deserts and the ocean, having essentially choked out all other Takagi flora. The World Tree has been slowly receding ever since the arrival of the first human settlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rainbow_grass_specimen;Herba da Vella Specimen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rainbow_grass_specimen_desc;A grass-like species native to Nueva Galicia, herba da vella is named for an evolutionary response to Nueva Galicia's three suns - depending on local light conditions, which may vary dramatically depending on latitude, epigenetic triggers can cause it to deploy alternative pigments to chlorophyll - depending on which sun is most prominent at its latitude, herba da vella may appear green, red, or blue, in order to efficiently absorb the most light. In captivity, herba da vella is grown under special lighting conditions to favor particular colors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
touchdown_tumbleweed_specimen;Touchdown Tumbleweed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
touchdown_tumbleweed_specimen_desc;Native to the semi-arid steppes of Touchdown II, the Touchdown tumbleweed is notable as a plant-like species that releases a living, rather than dead, tumbleweed. As the plant's roots absorb nutrients, they loosen the soil, until it becomes loose enough that the entire plant can be picked up and blown by Touchdown II's combination of strong winds and low gravity. As the tumbleweed rolls, it releases spores, before finally coming to rest in soil that resists its roots and setting them down again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
